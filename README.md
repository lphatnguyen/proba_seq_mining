# Efficient Dynamic Texture Classification with Probabilistic Motifs

## Introduction
This repository is for our research contribution dedicated to video classification by means of dynamic texture modeling. In this program, we mainly focused on how to construct the *p-sequences*, mine probabilistically frequent motifs and create a new representation for video data of dynamic tetures. In this code, we demonstrates two ways of mining key motifs using both Numpy (for simple CPU computation) and PyTorch (for using GPU computation).
